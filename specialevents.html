                    <p>Arguably the biggest festival in the world (not to mention its wildest party), Brazil’s Carnival is widely considered “the greatest show on Earth.”
                        The event attracts nearly 5 million people each year, with a half-million or so being visitors traveling to see the spectacle.

                <article>
                    <p> Also known as Fat Tuesday, Mardi Gras in New Orleans is a cultural spectacle to behold– sort of like the USA version of Carnival. But there is some debate over whether it was NOLA or Mobile, Alabama that had the first Mardi Gras back in the 1700s.

                <article>
                    <p>Although Cinco de Mayo may be more well-known in the US, this is arguably Mexico’s most important and widely celebrated holiday.In fact, it’s important enough that it was added to UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.More commonly known in English-speaking countries as the Day of the Dead, the festivities begin on October 31 and last through November 2.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The rest of the world could learn a thing or two from The Netherlands about properly celebrating a national dignitary’s birthday.Queen’s Day was a national holiday (celebrated on April 30 until 2013) commemorating Queen Beatrix’s birth. So what if her Royal Highness was actually born in late January?!By having the festivities in pleasant April, the proud Dutch were able to throw on their loud orange attire and toss back a few drinks without having to worry about weather.</p>
